                        ISSUES AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

1. [X] Save employee button is creating a long list of employees.

A. [X] Limit the amount of employees created so users don't endlessly scroll.
B. Create a "Go back to top" button at the bottom of the page. 
C. [ ] Create a separate page to view the saved employees (this solutions creates
more realestate for the Employee data list, grow the list to 10 data fields)
D. Optional: Render only one employee. This way, I can create the (copy, delete, update, share
buttons as a pop up options when a user press and hold the saved employee data)
